## PS.Utils -- some useful things
Herein are some useful PowerShell things
|  Item  | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Get-ArgumentCompleter.ps1 | get the argument completers that are registered in the current PowerShell session; minor update to the awesome function by Chris Dent (@indented-automation on GitHub)
| Invoke-ActivatePythonVirtualenv.ps1 | updated/improved (more "PowerShell-y") way to activate a Python virtual environment; based on the default `activate.ps1` that comes with a virtual environment created by `virtualenv`
| Start-Demo.ps1 | extended version of the beloved `Start-Demo` script for presenting / stepping through code for demo in presentations / talks (which is originally by Jeffrey Snover himself)
